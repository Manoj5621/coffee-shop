🔹 1. Project Title & Description
# AI-Powered Coffee Shop Ordering System


This is the main heading of your project.

Below it, I added a short description (taken from your report) so anyone visiting your GitHub will instantly know what the project does:

Full-stack web app (ReactJS + FastAPI + MongoDB).

AI-powered chatbot for mood-based coffee/snack suggestions.

Admin dashboard for managing orders.

🔹 2. Features Section
## Features
- 🔐 Secure user authentication
- 🛒 Dynamic cart and order management
- 🤖 AI-powered chatbot
- 📊 Admin dashboard
- ☁️ MongoDB Atlas for database


This is a summary of what your project can do.

People reading your README won’t go through the whole report, so this highlights the main selling points quickly.

🔹 3. Setup Instructions

This part tells users how to download and run your project.

Clone Repository – shows how to get the code using Git.

Virtual Environment (Backend) – creates a separate Python environment for FastAPI.

Install Dependencies – install backend (requirements.txt) and frontend (npm install).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```env
MONGO_URI="your_mongo_connection_string"
SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key_here"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here" 
```


Instead of showing real keys, we give placeholders.

I added a warning not to upload .env to GitHub (for security).

🔹 4. Running the Project
